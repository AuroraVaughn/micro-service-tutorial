# Initially from nodejs-microservices-starter-udemy totorial. 

## (Warning) Do not use this code as an example. 
I am following a slightly out of date tutorial to gain some experience going through the steps of setting up microservices. The tutorial is using out of date version due to recent API changes in certian packages. I plan to remedy this when/if I finish the whole project. 

At some point I will deviate from this project and break code for experimentation. Those experiments will be bad patterns and not a how to. They will often be for confirming my understanding of how something works, or what breaks the service.
